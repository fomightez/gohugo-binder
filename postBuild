# ----------Install GO language -------------
# based on https://github.com/go-hep/binder/blob/master/postBuild
# and https://golang.org/dl/
# UPDATE: moved go installation to apt based on https://github.com/aborruso/bashnotebook/blob/master/binder/apt.txt
# note though below was working except wasn't in the path so I could type `go` (somehow hugo which uses it seemed to work desipte that). probably needed to add
# a link to it in `~/.local/bin` like does at https://github.com/aborruso/bashnotebook/blob/0de5d657de745fffe53ed1acc35d01c75d389b6e/binder/postBuild#L48

# Install up-to-date HUGO. Apt only is getting version 0.40
# Following directions at https://vexxhost.com/resources/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-hugo-the-static-site-generator-on-ubuntu-14-04/
# and combining with more up to date info at https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-hugo-on-ubuntu-debian/
# didn't work because I couldn't use dpkg without superuse permissions
# So now I install old version (0.40) with apt and when run `which hugo`, I get `/usr/bin/hugo`. And now going to try to update that
#  to more recent adapting instructions from https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#install-hugo-from-tarball (it is from mac
# but may be useful for updating)
