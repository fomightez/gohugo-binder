Technical details
-----------------

This repo results in a system with current version (go1.13.6 when type `go version`) of Go language on it. This is important because athough you can use `apt.txt` to install the go language, as based on [here](https://github.com/aborruso/bashnotebook/blob/master/binder/apt.txt), that currently is way beyond (version 1.10 something). **I didn't realize until later that you only need Go installed if you are compiling Hugo from source**, see [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/quick-start-doesnt-work-on-ubuntu/14686/2). However, leaving here because nice to have installation of current Go language worked out for the Binder system, and I may think 'Go language' when I think of 'Hugo'.
